## 📚 Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document and share the work I've been studying in Database Fundamentals. Databases are a fundamental component of modern software systems, and a solid understanding of database concepts is crucial for anyone pursuing a career in computer science or related fields. By sharing my college works, I hope to contribute to the learning experience of others and provide examples of database-related projects.

## 🚧  Project Status

the project is completed and tested. Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and use them to enhance your understanding of SQL and databases knowledge.
